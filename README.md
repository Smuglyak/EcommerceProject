### The general goal of the project:
#### Foodie Marketplace
We will build a marketplace Web Application where a customer can order food online.

Our project will support the following stories:
1. As a customer, I can Register, Login, Logout and 2-Factor Authentication (these are not new features - they are given in class)

2. As a customer, I can Look through Menu (catalog of the foods)(a feature?)
3. As a customer, I can List the menu by price, categories, etc.
5. As a customer, I can View the meal description and ingredients
8. As a customer, I can Add, Delete or Modify the quantity of the order (3 features)
9. As a customer, I can Change my password if I forget 
11. As a customer, I can Checkout my order
12. As a customer, I can Favorite a specific food on the menu, and it will be Added or Deleted to my favorite meal section in my profile (2 features)
13. As a customer, I can Check my account and/or Change my information (first name and last name)
14. As a customer, I can Check my purchase history
15. As a customer, I can Check offers on food
16. As a customer, I can Search for a specific product
20. As a customer, I can Rate a food and Leave a comment
21. As an admin, I can Add, Delete or Update a combo (3 features)
22. As an admin, I can Add, Delete or Update food (3 features)
23. As an admin, I can Add, Delete or Update food categories (3 features)
- Not the final features. We might add more and update the proposal.
- (* - features that might changed due to difficulty of implementation)

Our web application will be slightly similar to the Mcdonalds mobile application. 
We will be spending approximately 180 hours or more building this product.

#### Teacher's comments:
16. As a customer, I can Order a delivery **(How does this differ from #11 Checking out an order?)**
